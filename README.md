# knights-tour-rs
Knights tour enumeration using an ant colony algorithm written in Rust.

Based on [a paper by Philip Hingston and Graham Kendall](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgxk/papers/cec05knights.pdf).

This is my first Rust project so I am sure the code is not great! Constructive criticism is greatly appreciated.
